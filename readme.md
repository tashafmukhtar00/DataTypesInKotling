## Variable

As you know, a variable is a location in memory (storage area) to hold data.

## dentifier

To indicate the storage area, each variable should be given a unique name (identifier).


## Difference Between var and val

val (Immutable reference) - The variable declared using val keyword cannot be changed once the value is assigned. It is similar to final variable in Java.

var (Mutable reference) - The variable declared using var keyword can be changed later in the program. It corresponds to regular Java variable.
